\section{Introduction}

\hspace{0.7cm}This is group 10’s project report which makes up 40\% of our final results of the “Advanced programming with Python” course. This course, including the most fundamental parts that we should know about Python language namely: OOP, Modules and Packages…, was led by the enthusiasm of Dr. Tran Giang Son.

In this report, we will explain carefully about the program that we presented and ran the demo on Thursday 27/5/2021: What our program does; Why people should use it; and How we could manage to create the Restaurant Information Management System.

Thank you, Dr. Tran Giang Son, for giving us the chance to access so much valuable knowledge and precious practical sessions about the Python language.
